## to run this you need to have node and npm installed
## npm is like rubygems for node

$ brew install node
$ brew install npm

## and you need to have the express and ejs npm package installed

$ npm install express
$ npm install ejs

## in order for them to work you need to setup two environment vars.  
## Do this in your ~/.profile or ~/.bash_profile and then open a new shell.

export NODE_PATH="/usr/local/lib/node"
export PATH="/usr/local/share/npm/bin:$PATH"

## then to run it just type

$ node mud.js

## to run the Ruby version do

$ bundle install
$ bundle exec thin -r config.ru start

## and thats the way it is
